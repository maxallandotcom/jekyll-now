Since 11:20am I had to research about cute kawaii characters and then then try to create my own. I listened to “los forasteros” podcast on youtube and found some cute drawings that I really liked, still I need to practice more.

When I was drawing some sketches I was interrupted by a notification, I received a big order on fiverr. It sounds so good that I thought it could be a scam, still I think it worth the risk. It’s a mariachi ad for a bar, sounds good. I started working on it.

I was still working on the ad but got hungry and went to the store. I bought stuff to cook and I just finished eating D: It’s really late and I haven’t finished yet.

It’s 8pm and I just finished editing the video. I spent most of the time trying to learn how to fix bad audio.

I still need to draw a little bit more...
